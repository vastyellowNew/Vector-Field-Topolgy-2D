# Vector-Field-Topolgy-2D
Vector field topology (VFT) [Ref. 1, 2] is an intuitive visualization technique of vector fields. It is a representation of the global topology based on an analysis of the critical points and their connections. For a complex vector field, it can be difficult to understand the field properties by plotting streamlines or field lines (quiver). VFT techniques give a minimalistic representation of the field which is more intuitve.

VFT methods have been used in many fields including fluid flow analysis, computer vision and photonics.
